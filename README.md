# Node.js Project
This Project contains 3 sub programs: 
- Hello World Program: Prints "HELLO WORLD" to the console as is saved in the file 'hello-world.js'.
- Node.js Server: This program creates a simple Node.js server that responds with `<h1>Hello Node!!!!</h1>` when accessed at http://localhost:3000. The program is stored in 'main.js' file.
- File System: This program demonstrates file system operations by creating a file named "welcome.txt" with the content "Hello Node" and then reading and logging the content to the console. The program is saved in 'file-operation.js'.
- Password Generator Program: This program uses the `generate-password` package to generate a random password and logs it to the console. The program is saved in 'password-generator' file.
- Email Sender Program: This program uses the `nodemailer` package to send a test email to yourself using Gmail. The program is stored in 'email-sender file.
